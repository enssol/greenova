      - Added `CompanyAccessMixin` to enforce access control for company-related views.

    - **Views**:
      - Implemented class-based views for company CRUD operations (`ListView`, `CreateView`, `UpdateView`, `DeleteView`).

    - **Templates**:
      - Created and updated templates for listing, viewing, creating, editing, and deleting companies.
      - Introduced reusable base templates for forms.

    - **Static Files**:
      - Migrated CSS to SCSS for better maintainability and added new SCSS components for company-related styles.

    - **URLs**:
